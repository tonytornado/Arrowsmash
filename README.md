Project 4rrowsmash
---
This is a rather simple little project that is dedicated to tracking scores in Dance Dance Revolution.  
What am I generally working to accomplish here?


**Immediate goals**
* Basic score tracking with a leader board system.
* Social network features such as post feeds and followers
* Support for leagues and league events
* Analytics!


 
**What might come down the line?**
* Integration with E-AMUSE (BLARG!!)
* Integrated Card Draw system for tournament play
* Support for tournaments and tracking results (Challonge used separately)

This is a simple little project done by some guy who really likes rhythm games.
