Project Arrowsmash!
---
This is a rather simple little project that is dedicated to tracking scores in Dance Dance Revolution.  
What am I generally working to accomplish here?

* Basic score tracking with a leaderboard system.
* Social network features such as posting feeds and friendships
* A rather robust library of features associated with news and blogging

_Those are the immediate goals._

_What might come down the line?_
* Integration with E-AMUSE
* Integrated Card Draw system for tournament play
* Support for tournaments and tracking results (Challonge used separately)
